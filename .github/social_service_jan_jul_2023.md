## About

The project, identified as "SISTEMA DE APOYO PARA EL APRENDIZAJE DE PROGRAMACIÓN PARA ESTUDIANTES CON PROBLEMAS DE REZAGO Y DESERCIÓN" and conducted by the Dr. Edgar Cambranez Martínez, appeared as a strategy to solve the necessity of helping those students that have been struggling to keep up with their classes by providing them with both a repository full of many different exercises and a tool that would help them by testing their code and printing their results.

Also, not only it would be of use to the student, but the teacher too. The best outcome would be providing every teacher with an easy to configure application that can display metrics and give a broader point of view of the current state of their students, and then they could design a set of problems perfectly fit to polish their capacities, leading to a continuous process of monitoring and reinforcing.

Finally, it is important to mention that the requirements included that the professor should be able to post a set of exercises in a single repository and automatically test all of them every time a student uploaded their progress to their own repositories.

## The first approach

### Experiment

> Jonathan - Mention what we wanted, how we created the repo (add a link), and how we applied the exercises to the students.

### Results

After doing the first experiment we were left with some feedback:

- The students found very hard to install every required dependency.
- Many students had problems trying to execute Test-Runner.
- A lot of students didn't even try to solve the exercises, or at least generate their work repositories.
- The teachers required some data that the application wasn't able to generate.
- There was a strange problem with the GitHub actions that froze the tests to the point of reaching their maximum alive time, so their processes ended up being stopped.

## The second approach

### Creating a reader

> Rich - Mention the new objective, the requirements, what we got and link the repo.

### Current state

> Rich - Mention how we couldn't continue because of the job freezing issue.

## Future alternatives

> Jonathan - Mention the possible fix of including timeouts, using other tools such as GitHub Classroom, or creating a VS extension to run it locally.
